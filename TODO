MUST HAVE
* Write README with some semblance of dox
* Implement a few more examples out of Koza's book

NICE TO HAVE
* Overselection
* Bias node selection in crossover by terminal/nonterminal status (i.e. node selection is 90% likely to choose an internal node)
* Elite reproduction
* Tournament selection
* Rank selection
* Mutation
* De-serialize programs from S-expressions
* Optimize programs
* Hooks for visualizers
* Adapters for Hadoop/EMR
* Save and load programs

CODE QUALITY
* Change all those (Program, Fitness) tuples that litter the code into proper objects
* Attempts to breed an odd number of programs by crossover should be handled gracefully
* Break up the giant Population param list
* Do the tests rely too heavily on spying?
